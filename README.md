#Installation

This module is distributed using [npm](https://npmjs.com) which comes bundled with [node](https://nodejs.org):

```console
npm install react-quill
```

Quick start
-----------

### Use it straight away:

~~~jsx
var MyComponent = React.createClass({

  onTextChange: function(value) {
    this.setState({ text:value });
  },

  render: function() {
    return (
      <ReactQuill value={this.state.text}
                  onChange={this.onTextChange} />
    );
  },

});
~~~

### Theming, custom toolbar and formats, custom editing area:

~~~jsx
/*
Include `quill.snow.css` to use the editor's standard theme. For example,
depending on the structure of your app, you could do something like this:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/react-quill/dist/quill.snow.css">
*/

var MyComponent = React.createClass({

  modules: {
    toolbar: [
      [{ 'header': [1, 2, false] }],
      ['bold', 'italic', 'underline','strike', 'blockquote'],
      [{'list': 'ordered'}, {'list': 'bullet'}, {'indent': '-1'}, {'indent': '+1'}],
      ['link', 'image'],
      ['clean']
    ],
  },

  formats: [
    'header',
    'bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'strike', 'blockquote',
    'list', 'bullet', 'indent',
    'link', 'image'
  ],

  render: function() {
    return (
      <div className="text-editor">
        <ReactQuill theme="snow"
                    modules={this.modules}
                    formats={this.formats}>
          <div key="editor"
                ref="editor"
                className="quill-contents my-class-name"
                dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html:this.state.editorContent}}/>
        </ReactQuill>
      </div>
    );
  },

});
~~~

### Mixing in:

~~~jsx
var MyComponent = React.createClass({
  mixins: [ ReactQuill.Mixin ],

  componentDidMount: function() {
    var editor = this.createEditor(
      this.getEditorElement(),
      this.getEditorConfig()
    );
    this.setState({ editor:editor });
  },

  componentWillReceiveProps: function(nextProps) {
    if ('value' in nextProps && nextProps.value !== this.props.value) {
      this.setEditorContents(this.state.editor, nextProps.value);
    }
  },

});
~~~

See [component.js](src/component.js) for a fully fleshed-out example.


Styles and themes
-----------------
The Quill editor supports themes.

It includes a full-fledged theme, called _snow_, that is Quill's standard appearance, and a _base_ theme containing only the bare essentials to allow modules like toolbars or tooltips to work.

These stylesheets can be found in the Quill distribution, but for convenience they are also linked among React Quill's `dist`s. In a common case you would activate a theme like this:

    <ReactQuill theme="snow" />

And then link the appropriate stylesheet:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/react-quill/dist/quill.snow.css">

This may vary depending how application is structured, directories or otherwise. For example, if you use a CSS pre-processor like SASS, you may want to import that stylesheet inside your own.


Upgrading to React-Quill v1.0.0
-------------------------------
Please note that many [migration steps to Quill v1.0](http://quilljs.com/guides/upgrading-to-1-0/) may also apply.

### The toolbar module

With v1.0.0, Quill adopted a new [toolbar configuration format](https://quilljs.com/docs/modules/toolbar/), to which React Quill will delegates all toolbar functionality, and which is now the preferred way to customize the toolbar.

Previously, toolbar properties could be set by passing a `toolbar` prop to React Quill. Pass the same options as `modules.toolbar` instead.

~~~diff
+ modules: {
    toolbar: [
       ...
    ],
+ },
  
  <ReactQuill
-   toolbar={this.toolbar}
+   modules={this.modules}
  />
~~~

If you provided your own HTML toolbar component, you can still do the same:

~~~diff
+ modules: {
+   toolbar: '#my-toolbar-component',
+ },
  
  <ReactQuill
-   toolbar="#my-toolbar-component"
+   modules={this.modules}
  />
~~~

Previously, React Quill would create a custom HTML toolbar for you if you passed a configuration object as the `toolbar` prop. This will not happen anymore. You can still create a `ReactQuill.Toolbar` explicitly:

~~~diff
+ modules: {
+   toolbar: '#my-quill-toolbar',
+ },

+ <ReactQuill.Toolbar
+   id='my-quill-toolbar'
+   items={this.oldStyleToolbarItems}
+ />

  <ReactQuill
-   toolbar={this.oldStyleToolbarItems}
+   modules={this.modules}
  />
~~~

However, consider switching to the new Quill format instead, or provide your own toolbar component.

React Quill now follows the Quill toolbar format closely. See the [Quill toolbar documentation](https://quilljs.com/docs/modules/toolbar/) for a complete reference on all supported options.

### Custom formats with the `formats` property is _deprecated_

As of 1.0.0, [use Parchment to define new formats](https://github.com/quilljs/parchment). Use the [Quill export](#exports) from the module to register and extend formats:

```js
Quill.register('formats/CustomFormat', MyCustomFormat);
```

### The `styles` property

Previously, it was allowed to inject CSS styles by providing an object to the `styles` property. This option has been removed from Quill 1.0, and support for it in React Quill has gone as well. If you need to inject styles, link an external stylesheet instead.

See the [Quill Release Notes](http://quilljs.com/guides/upgrading-to-1-0/#configuration).

### The `pollInterval` property

This property previously set the frequency with which Quill polled the DOM for changes. It does not have any effect anymore, and can safely be removed from the props.


Bundling with Webpack
---------------------
Quill ships only a pre-built javascript file, so Webpack will complain:

~~~
Error: ./~/react-quill/~/quill/dist/quill.js
Critical dependencies:
6:478-485 This seems to be a pre-built javascript file. Though this is possible, it's not recommended. Try to require the original source to get better results.
@ ./~/react-quill/~/quill/dist/quill.js 6:478-485
~~~

The warning is harmless, but if you want to silence it you can avoid parsing Quill by adding this to your Webpack configuration:

~~~js
module: {
  // Shut off warnings about using pre-built javascript files
  // as Quill.js unfortunately ships one as its `main`.
  noParse: /node_modules\/quill\/dist/
}
~~~

See [#7](https://github.com/zenoamaro/react-quill/issues/7) for more details.


API reference
-------------

### Exports

`ReactQuill.Mixin`
: Provides the bridge between React and Quill. `ReactQuill` implements this mixin; in the same way you can use it to build your own component, or replace it to implement a new core for the default component.

`ReactQuill.Toolbar`
: The component that renders the custom ReactQuill toolbar. The default collection of items and color swatches is available as `ReactQuill.Toolbar.defaultItems` and `ReactQuill.Toolbar.defaultColors` respectively. ‚ö†Ô∏è The Toolbar component is deprecated since v1.0.0. See [upgrading to React Quill v1.0.0](#upgrading-to-react-quill-v1-0-0).

`ReactQuill.Quill`
: The `Quill` namespace on which you can call `registerModule` and such.


### Props

`id`
: ID to be applied to the DOM element.

`className`
: Classes to be applied to the DOM element.

`value`
: Value for the editor as a controlled component. Note that due to limitations in Quill, this is actually a _semi-controlled_ mode, meaning that the edit is not prevented, but changing `value` will still replace the contents.

`defaultValue`
: Initial value for the editor as an uncontrolled component.

`readOnly`
: If true, the editor won't allow changing its contents.

`placeholder`
: The default value for the empty editor.

`modules`
: An object specifying which modules are enabled, and their configuration. The editor toolbar is a commonly customized module. See the [modules section](http://quilljs.com/docs/modules/) over the Quill documentation for more information on what modules are available.

`formats`
: An array of formats to be enabled during editing. All implemented formats are enabled by default. See [Formats](http://quilljs.com/docs/formats/) for a list. 
  Custom formats should not be included in the array as of version 1.0.0. Instead they should be created through [Parchment](https://github.com/quilljs/parchment) and registered with the module's [Quill export](#exports).

`style`
: An object with custom CSS rules to apply on the editor's container. Rules should be in React's "camelCased" naming style.

`theme`
: The name of the theme to apply to the editor. Defaults to `base`.

`bounds`
: Selector or DOM element used by Quill to constrain position of popups. Defaults to `document.body`.

`onChange(content, delta, source, editor)`
: Called back with the new contents of the editor after change. It will be passed the HTML contents of the editor, a delta object expressing the change-set itself, the source of the change, and finally a read-only proxy to editor accessors such as `getText()`.

`onChangeSelection(range, source, editor)`
: Called back with the new selected range, or null when unfocused. It will be passed the selection range, the source of the change, and finally a read-only proxy to editor accessors such as `getBounds()`.

`onKeyPress(event)`
: Called after a key has been pressed and released.
: Note that, like its native counterpart, this won't be called for special keys such as <kbd>shift</kbd> or <kbd>enter</kbd>. If you need those, hook onto `onKeyDown` or `onKeyUp`.

`onKeyDown(event)`
: Called after a key has been pressed, but before it is released.
: Note that, due to how Quill works, it's possible that you won't receive events for keys such as <kbd>enter</kbd>, <kbd>backspace</kbd> or <kbd>delete</kbd>. If that's the case, try hooking onto `onKeyUp` instead.

`onKeyUp(event)`
: Called after a key has been released.


### Methods

If you have [a ref to a ReactQuill node](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/more-about-refs.html) ([Codepen example](https://codepen.io/alexkrolick/pen/YNmGar?editors=0011)), you will be able to invoke the following methods:

`focus()`
: Focuses the editor.

`blur()`
: Removes focus from the editor.

`getEditor()`
: Returns the Quill instance that backs the editor. While you can freely use this to access methods such as `getText()`, please avoid from imperatively manipulating the instance.


Building and testing
--------------------
You can run the automated test suite:

    $ npm test

And build a minificated version of the source:

    $ npm run build

More tasks are available on the [Makefile](Makefile):

    lint: lints the source
    spec: runs the test specs
    coverage: runs the code coverage test
    test: lint, spec and coverage threshold test
    build: builds the minified version

Note that `dist` is ignored in the git repository as of version 1.0.0. If you need to use the built files without downloading the package from NPM, you can run the build tasks yourself or use a CDN like [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/react-quill@1.0.0-beta-1/dist/react-quill.min.js).

Browser support
---------------

Please check the browser support table for the upstream [Quill](https://github.com/quilljs/quill) dependency. The React part of the codebase is ES5-compatible.
